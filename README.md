## 📡 About

This is a cursed AI visualizer that combines **Simulated Annealing** and **Backpropagation** with the raw unfiltered power of a custom graphics engine (JkrGUI).  
Watch as neural networks evolve in real-time and generate trippy heatmaps. It's basically education, but with epilepsy warnings.

> 🧪 Final semester AI project at IOE, Pulchowk Campus  
> 💾 ~10K lines of confused neurons and Vulkan hacks

## 🔬 Core Features (a.k.a. Features that Sorta Work)

| Feature                    | Status         | Notes                                     |
|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Neural Network Visualization | ✅ Functional | You can actually see neurons connect      |
| Simulated Annealing         | ✅ Included     | Surprisingly, works better than expected  |
| Backpropagation             | ✅ Functional   | Just enough to pass the semester          |
| Pixel Density Map           | 🎨 Psychedelic | Perfect for deep learning trippers        |
| Save/Load                   | ❌ Nonexistent | You guessed it — you can’t save anything  |
| UI Responsiveness           | 🤖 Robotic     | It responds, just not always sensibly     |
